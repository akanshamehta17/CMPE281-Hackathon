Summary: 

- It's a team project of four people where 3 team members individually worked on backend Starbucks store and 1 team member worked on middleware Kong Gateway and all members contributed to frontend.

- Created a backened Starbucks store 2 that receives REST API calls from frontend portal through Kong Gateway(middleware).

- The backend is written in Java using a restlet framework and Mongo DB.

- The Starbucks server handles routing of REST calls and Starbucks API handles the connection to the DB and performs the query operations.

- Deployed the Starbucks store (backend) on AWS ec2 instance.
