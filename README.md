# CMPE281-Hackathon
< multi-cloud Starbucks Drink Ordering portal based on the Restbucks CRUD REST API design>

- Created a backened Starbucks store that receives REST API calls from frontend portal through Kong Gateway(middleware).
- The backend is written in Java using a restlet framework and Mongo DB.
- The Starbucks server handles routing of REST calls and Starbucks API handles the connection to the DB and performs the query operations.
- Deployed the Starbucks store (backend) on AWS ec2 instance.
